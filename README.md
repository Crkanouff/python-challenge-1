# FOCO Food Truck
This programs automate the order taking function at a food truck. It uses a dictionary & looping to gather, track and then print information back to the customer.  The dictionary is nested and includes items within the menu categories. For example, Snack has several key and value options. 

# Data Categoriesk
order_list collects the order including item name, price and quantity
menu_items is the dictionary is all menu categories and food items, price

Customer Input:
menu_category
menu_selection
quantity

The program compiles the order, prints what has been ordered and the final cost.

# Resources
I used the notebook created by instructor to help program this - as much of the code was provided.  In addition, I had a tutoring session with our TA on the looping functions as I did not understand how they worked.  In addition, I reviewed dictionaries, for loops and printing in "Begging Programming with Python" and finally, looked at Stack Overflow to find answers to my questions and GHATGpt to help with list comprehension.
